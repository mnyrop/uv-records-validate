    "description": "This photo is one of of 86 photos that represents locations of street art, graffiti, murals, and other scenes of the Black Lives Matter movement that took place in Soho, New York City in early-June, 2020. The images were captured in the days following the murder of George Floyd, who was killed while in police custody in Minneapolis, MN on May 25, 2020. Many images depict shuttered storefronts that have been covered with graffiti, murals, and artwork. These expressions constitute celebration of Black life and outrage for the violence and brutality Black people have experienced at the hands of the police. Please be advised that this collection contains images with profane words and epithets that are borne of race-based violence and hatred.",
